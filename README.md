# pholio

Pholio is a responsive one-page theme for an online portfolio website. Its main feature is a grid of project cards. On click, these open pop-up windows where further details about a project are displayed, together with an image, a carousel (available in various flavors), or an embedded video. Two more sections are included to provide more about the user, such as a biography or a professional statement.

The typography is based on the [Alegreya Sans family](https://www.huertatipografica.com/en/fonts/alegreya-sans-ht), which adds a calligraphic touch to the traditional cleanliness and legibility of sans-serif typefaces. Additional liveliness is provided by the use of [Typed.js](https://mattboldt.com/demos/typed-js/) to alternate between subheadings in the title section. The theme ships with a 404 page that links back to the index.

Visit the [demo website](https://pholio.netlify.app) to see the theme in action.

## Installation

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Rename it to `[username].github.io`.
3.  Start editing!

## Usage

<!--
Configuration primarily occurs in four files. First, `_config.yml`, which contains site variables such as title, tagline, url, and repository address, as well as the author's name and email address for inclusion in blog posts. There is also a variable that specifies a photo for inclusion in the homepage. This is optional and can be removed.

Second, you should update icon links in `_includes/particles-home.html` and add/remove icons as needed. You might want to add icons that are not included by default. For more information on how to do this, see [this blog post](https://cvless.netlify.app/2022/08/01/on-the-use-of-icons/).

Third, you should customize the file `_includes/contact.html` by inputting your contact details and adding/removing lines as needed. This information is prepended to your CV. It is possible to customize the icons that appear in this file: for more information, see the blog post above.

Fourth, you might want to edit the style variables specified in `_sass/_variables.scss`. These allow you to customize the theme's color scheme and typefaces. There are many resources on the web to learn the principles of good web design. I personally recommend Matthew Butterick's [Practical Typography](https://practicaltypography.com/), which also covers [websites](https://practicaltypography.com/websites.html).

In addition to these files, you can customize favicons in the `assets` folder. For that, [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) is an excellent tool. You can also change the particles.js configurations in `assets/json`. The [particles.js homepage](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) features an interactive tool from which you can export a new configuration.
